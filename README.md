# dst-dedicated-server-scripts
A collection of scripts to run and manage Don't Starve Together dedicated servers

## Quick start guide
### Prerequisites ###
The steam must already be installed in your system. Go to https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD for instructions (the QuickStart used the manual installation into the user home directory)
A server along with a token must already be extracted to the klei dst directory. Go to https://accounts.klei.com/login to create your server template and token. 
This guide does not cover these two steps and assumes it has already been done. 

### Installation and Setup ###
Clone the repo to your system. All directories in these instructions will be in the users home directory. 

```
git clone https://github.com/suppaduppax/dst-dedicated-server-scripts
```

Now go into that directory

```
cd dst-dedicated-server-scripts
```

First thing that needs to be done is the `settings.conf` file needs to be created. 
Copy the settings.conf.template file as a starting point

```
cp settings.conf.template settings.conf
```

Edit the settings to match your environment. For this example we will be using nano but use whichever editor you want to.

```
nano settings.conf
```

Here is an example of a working settings file:

```/home/user/dst-dedicated-server-scripts/settings.conf```

```
# Do not put anything in quotes
# Do not put any spaces before or after the equals sign
# See http://github.com/suppaduppax/dst-dedicated-server-scripts/ for details
